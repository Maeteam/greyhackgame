The following post will include almost everything that i think grey hack is missing in terms of quality of life and details.
## Browser update
adding multiple tabs on the browser and making the RAM usage act accordingly,
combining it with html's <title> method, you could have tabs with names on them
if powerUI doesnt support that you could create a custom parser to find the title.
another cool feature would be to change the cursor with html page via cursor: default; cursor: pointer;
to hint the user on what he can do, and generally add better UX.
another crucial feature is to link to another website, could be used with `href="www.website.com"`
the scroll bar feature is extremly needed, since we already know its possible with javascript.
you could add the script snippet to the bottom of the code, or you could add it somehow through unity, like many other scrollable apps.
another feature that is really good but very hard to add is multiple html pages, so the link would look like: `"www.website.com/index.html"`
(`www.website.com` would take you automatically to `www.website.com/index.html`)
so you could also href another html file in same directory, and index is the default.
basically like subdomains, you could link to a specific page within a website.
and of course, it wouldnt hurt to add a little bit more fonts for customization.
lastly, remove forcing to use www. prefix on websites.
### Browser update
- Multiple browser tabs
    - Working <title></title> methods
- Cursor modes, at least `pointer`, and `default`
- Linking to outside websites
- Scrollable web pages by default.
- multiple html pages 
- more fonts & remove www. prefix force.
## Ransomware & DDOS.
currently ransomware & ddos have no reason to be used.
### Ransomware
ransomware lockdown requires root permissions, if you have that you might aswell look into Config/Bank.txt
now im not saying you should delete it, but i think instead of having the file with user:md5(pwd)
it should be a file with plaintext like User:mysecretpassword **BUT** the file itself is encrypted using crypto library.
the key for encrypting it is the password, this also works for mail.txt
### DDOS
DDOS seems to be going in a good direction so far, but my main addition would be - 
to make shops your main source of income, that could mean lowering the rewards from hackshop missions,
in order to sell software and/or hardware
that way you can stop someones main income,
## PDFs
I already covered it in #"PDF files" 

## Those are my main inqueries.
if someone else wants to add please do!
